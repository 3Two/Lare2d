Version 3.3 - May 2018
----------------------
1. Added Boris Alfven speed limiters



Version 3.2 - February 2018
---------------------------
1. Replaced the optically thin radiative losses with a treatement based on Townsend 
exact integration. How to use this is documented in the source code radiative.f90 
and background added to the manual.
2. Renamed the boundary condition BC_OTHER to BC_USER to match the expectation 
that this is supplied by the use not a default in the code.
3. Renamed the options for open boundaries inside openboundary.f90.
4  Tidied the code to make maintenance easier.
5. Use must now specific all values of MHD variable arrays in initial_condiction
and not rely on Lare2d to fill ghost cells as before.

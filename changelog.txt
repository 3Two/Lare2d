Version 3.2 - December 2017
---------------------------
1. Replaced the optically thin radiative losses with a treatement based on Townsend exact integration. 
How to use this is documented in the source code radiative.f90 and background added to the manual.
2. Renamed the boundary condition BC_OTHER BC_USER to match the expectation that this is supplied by the use not a default
in the code.
3. Renamed the options for open boundaries ready for planned changes.
